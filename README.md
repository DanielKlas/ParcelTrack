# ParcelTrack
This is my very first project on .NET 5. It is a tracking system for a firm of couriers that manages deliveries in Edinburgh area.
You may add, edit and assign parcels to couriers, who operate within designated postcodes.
## Instructions
Go to bin/debug and run ParcelTrack.exe. It comes with pre-installed data. If you wish to use your own data, simply delete **parceltrack_couriers.csv** and **parceltrack_parcels.csv**.
Empty .csv files will be created upon launch.
## What I have learned
- WPF form manipulation in XAML
- LINQ collections
- Class constructors
- Data validation
- Persistent data manipulation
- Inheritance
- Writing meaningful log files
